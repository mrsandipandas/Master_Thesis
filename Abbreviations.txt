C-band (4 to 8 GHz) 

PER = polarization extinction range(ratio)

PR = Polarization rotator (which mainly change the PER and, to some extent, the polarization phase)

TPPS = tunable polarization phase shifters 

SOP = State of polarization

RS = rotator segments@

PIC = photonic integrated circuits

OEIC = optoelectronic integrated circuit
