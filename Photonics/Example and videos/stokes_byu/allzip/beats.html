<H1>BEATS</H1>
<H1>Animation of Beats</H1>

This animation shows how beats are produced from the superposition of
two waves.<P>

At the top of the screen, two traveling sine waves are shown.  They
have slightly different wavelengths and frequencies.  At the bottom
of the screen, the superposition of the two waves is shown.
Beats are produced as the two waves sometimes constructively interfere
and sometimes destructively interfere.<P>
