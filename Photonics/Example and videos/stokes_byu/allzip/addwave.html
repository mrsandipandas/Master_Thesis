<h2>Windows version</h2>

This is a windows program written by David Summers (freeware downloaded
over the internet).  It produces sine waves of various frequencies which are
superimposed and sent to the sound card.  
For each sine wave, the user can choose the
frequency and the relative amplitude.  The operation of the program is
user-friendly and self-evident.
