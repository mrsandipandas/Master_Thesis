<H1>Resolving two images</H1>

This animation shows the superposition of two images.  Each image is
the diffraction pattern obtained from passing the light from a point
source through a circular hole.  In the top half of the screen, the
images are shown separately.  In the bottom half, the sum of the two
images are shown.  The sum is normalized so that the maximum
intensity is a constant.<P>

The program recognizes the following commands:

<TABLE> <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>+</B></TD>
<TD>Increase separation between the peaks.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>-</B></TD>
<TD>Decrease the separation between the peaks.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>Rayleigh</B></TD><TD> Move the peaks to positions
which satisfy the Rayleigh criterion: each peak is at the same position as the
first minimum of the other image.</TD>
