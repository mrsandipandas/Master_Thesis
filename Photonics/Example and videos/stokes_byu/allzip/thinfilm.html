<H1>THINFILM</H1>
<H1>Animation of Light Interacting with a Thin Film</H1>

This animation represents the transmission and reflection of light through
a thin film.  When the animation begins, the incident wave is in a medium
with index of refraction n<sub>1</sub>=1 (like air)
and the transmitted wave is in a medium with index of 
refraction n<sub>3</sub>=1.5 (like
glass).  The thin film has an index of refraction n<sub>2</sub>=1.38 
(like magnesium flouride).
The wavelength of the light (in air) is 633 nm (like a He-Ne laser).
The direction of the incident wave is normal to the film (incident angle is
zero).
The thickness of the film is d=115 nm.  At this value of d, 
the intensity of the
reflected wave is at a minimum.  The animation is simulating a nonreflective
coating on a glass surface.

<P>On the right side of the screen are shown the values of the 
indices of refraction.
On the left side of the screen are shown the relative intensities 
of the incident,
reflected, and transmitted waves.
The intensity of the waves are indicated by the
intensity of the colors of the waves in the animation.
Near the bottom edge of the screen are shown values for the angle 
of the incident
light (in degrees, measured from the normal to the surface), 
the wavelength of the
light in air (in nm), the thickness d of the film (in nm), 
and the polarization of the
incident wave (s or p).  The color of the light is indicated 
by the color of the
waves in the animation.  Infrared and ultraviolet light is 
indicated by black.<p>

Some parameters (n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub>, angle, 
d, wavelength, from, to) may be changed by the user.  Click on the name of
the parameter.  The background of that name should turn red.  Then
enter a number (including a decimal point if desired) at the keyboard
followed by pressing the <b>enter</b> key.  When the number is completely
entered, the new value of the parameter will appear on the screen unless
it is invalid.  
The values of 
n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub> must be between 1 and 2.5.
The value of angle must be between 0 and 89 degrees.
The value of d must be between 1 and 1000 nm.
The value of wavelength must be between 100 and 1000 nm.<p>

The program recognizes the following commands.<p>

<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>stop</B></TD><TD>
Stop animation.
Press <b>stop</b> again to resume animation.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>s_polarization</B></TD><TD>
This label indicates that the light is s polarized (<b>E</b> field
pointing in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the screen).
Pressing this button toggles the polarization to p.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>p_polarization</B></TD><TD>
This label indicates that the light is p polarized (<b>E</b> field
pointing in a direction parallel to the plane of the screen).
Pressing this button toggles the polarization to s.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>n<sub>1</sub></B></TD><TD>
Change the value of n<sub>1</sub>.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>n<sub>1</sub></B></TD><TD>
Change the value of n<sub>1</sub>.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>n<sub>1</sub></B></TD><TD>
Change the value of n<sub>1</sub>.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>angle</B></TD><TD>
Change the value of the angle of incidence.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>wavelength</B></TD><TD>
Change the value of the wavelength of the light in air.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>d</B></TD><TD>
Change the value of d.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>sweep</B></TD><TD>
Sweep the value of angle, wavelength, d, n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, 
or n<sub>2</sub>.  When you press <B>sweep</B>, new buttons appear on the
screen.  Press one of these to choose which parameter you want to sweep.
After pressing one of them, the <b>from</b> and <b>to</b> buttons appear
on the screen, allowing you to enter in the initial and final value
of the parameter for the sweep.  A <b>begin</b> button also appears.
Pressing it begins the sweep.  The sweep can be halted at any time
by pressing <b>sweep</b> again.</TD>
