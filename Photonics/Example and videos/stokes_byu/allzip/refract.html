<H1>Animation of Refraction of Light</H1>

<H2>Flash Version</H2>

This animation represents the refraction and reflection of light as it passes
from one medium into another.  When the animation begins, the incident and
reflected waves are in a medium with index of refraction 
n<sub>1</sub>=1 (like air),
and the refracted wave is in a medium with index of refraction 
n<sub>2</sub>=1.5 (like
glass).  On the right side of the screen are shown the values of the 
indices of refraction.
On the left side of the screen are shown the angles of incidence and 
refraction.<p>

Some parameters (n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, theta<sub>1</sub>, 
theta<sub>2</sub>) may be changed by the user.  Click on the name of
the parameter.  The background of that name should turn red.  Then
enter a number (including a decimal point if desired) at the keyboard
followed by pressing the <b>enter</b> key.  When the number is completely
entered, the new value of the parameter will appear on the screen unless
it is invalid.  Indices of refraction must be between 1 and 2.5 (including
1 and 2.5).
Angles must be between 0 and 90 (not including 0 and 90).<p>

The program recognizes the following commands.<p>

<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>stop</B></TD><TD>
Stop animation.
Press <b>stop</b> again to resume animation.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>reflection</B></TD><TD>
Remove the reflected wave.  Press <b>reflection</b> 
again to restore the reflected wave.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>frequency</B></TD><TD>
Frequency demonstration.  This demonstrates that the frequency of
the waves is the same on both sides of the interface.
Two "wave-front detectors" appear.
The detectors flash yellow each time a wave front passes through it.
You can see that the detectors are flashing at the same time and
therefore with the same frequency.  
Press <B>frequency</B> again to remove the detectors.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>velocity</B></TD><TD>
Velocity demonstration.  This demonstrates that the waves are
traveling slower in the medium with the largest index of refraction.  The
animation stops and a red dot appears on top of a wavefront on each side
of the interface.  Press <b>velocity</b> again and the waves resume their
motion.  After a few moments, the animation stops again so that you
can see how far each red dot has traveled.  You will see
that the wave in the medium with largest index of refraction has
traveled the least distance and is therefore
traveling the slowest.  Press <b>velocity</b> again to resume animation.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>sweep</B></TD><TD>
Sweep the angle of incidence from 0 to 89 degrees.  Press <b>sweep</b> again
to stop the sweep.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>reverse</B></TD><TD>
Reverse the direction of wave propagation.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>n<sub>1</sub>=</B></TD><TD>
Change the value of n<sub>1</sub>.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>n<sub>2</sub>=</B></TD><TD>
Change the value of n<sub>2</sub>.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>theta<sub>1</sub>=</B></TD><TD>
Change the value of the angle of incidence if the incident wave is coming from
the top half of the
screen.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>theta<sub>2</sub>=</B></TD><TD>
Change the value of the angle of incidence if the incident wave is coming from
the bottom half of the
screen.</TD>
