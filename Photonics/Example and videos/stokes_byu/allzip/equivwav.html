<H1>Animation of Equivalent Lattice Waves</H1>

This animation shows two equivalent lattice waves, one inside
the first Brillouin zone and the other outside.<P>

The wave number for the wave inside the first Brillouin zone is
k=pi/4a (wavelength=8a, moving in +x direction).<p>

The wave number for the wave outside the first Brillouin zone is
k=pi/4a-2pi/a=-7pi/4a (wavelength=8a/7, moving in -x direction).
