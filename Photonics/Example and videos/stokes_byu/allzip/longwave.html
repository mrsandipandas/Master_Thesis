<H1>Animation of Lattice Waves in a
One-Dimensional Monatomic Crystal</H1>

This animation shows lattice waves in a one-dimensional monatomic
crystal.<P>

To change the wavelength, simply enter at the keyboard any positive
integer.  (Press the "enter" key at the end of the number.)  This number
is the wavelength as a multiple number of lattice constants
