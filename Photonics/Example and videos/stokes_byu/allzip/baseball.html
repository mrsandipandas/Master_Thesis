<H1>Animation of two-dimensional projectile motion</H1>
<h2>Flash version</h2>

This animation shows the path of a baseball in two-dimensional
projectile motion.<P>

A baseball leaves the ground with both horizontal and vertical components
of velocity.  It follows a parabolic path and comes to rest on the ground
again.<P>

The program recognizes the following commands.  The command may be
executed by either clicking the button with the mouse (first column
below) or by pressing a key (second column below).
The mouse buttons may be removed from the screen by pressing the <b>M</b>
key.  Press <b>M</b> again to restore buttons.<p>
