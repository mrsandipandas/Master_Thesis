<H1>Animation of a sonic boom</H1>

This animation shows the waves propagating from an aircraft moving
at speeds greater than the speed of sound.  An audible boom is heard
when the edge of the wavefront reaches the man's ears.  The velocity
shown is with respect to the speed of sound.  The animation begins
with velocity=2 which means the aircraft is moving at twice the speed
of sound.<P>

The velocity may be changed by typing in a number (including decimal points
if desired) at the keyboard, followed by pressing the <b>enter</b> key.
When the value is completely entered, the value shown on the screen will
change to the new value.<p>

The program recognizes the following commands.
