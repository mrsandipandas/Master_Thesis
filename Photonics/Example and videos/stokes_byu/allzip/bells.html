<H1>BELLS</H1>
<H1>Demonstration of the Doppler Effect</H1>

This is a recording of the Carillon bells at Brigham Young University.
The recording is made from a car as it drives by.  The speed of the car
was 25 mph.  The bells were playing the first four measures of the hymn,
"Come, Come Ye Saints".  The car passed by the bells at the end of the
second measure.  This recording is contained in the sound file,
<a href="bells.wav">BELLS.WAV</a>.  I also made a shorter version of the recording by
removing space between strikes of the bell.  This shorter version
is contained in the sound file, <a href="bells2.wav">BELLS2.WAV </a>.<P>
