<H1>Reflection from Lattice</H1>

This animation shows the scattering of x rays from a set of lattice
points.<P>

The angles of the incident and scattered x rays are constrained to be
always equal.  Dragging the mouse across the figure causes the angles
to change.  At about 30 degrees, the scattered waves are all in phase
with each other.  This angle satisfies Bragg's Law.
