<H1>BALLS</H1>
<H1>Animation of a Monatomic Gas</H1>

The animation in BALLS4.EXE shows 4 balls bouncing around inside a box.
A red line divides the box in half.  The percentage of the balls
on each side of the box is displayed continuously above the box.
Sometimes, all of the balls are on one side of the box.<p>

The animation in BALLS50.EXE shows 50 balls bouncing around inside a box.
Now, the percentage of the balls on each side of the box remains
more near 50%.  There are rarely more than 65% of the balls on
one side of the box at a time.  However, this animation has been
"rigged" so that after about 50 seconds, all of the balls are
on one side of the box at the same time.  I estimate that if this
animation were not rigged, this event would be seen only once
every 50 million years (on the average).  After this unusual event,
the balls again return to random motion inside the box.<p>

The animation in SMILE.EXE is like BALLS50.EXE, except that the unusual
event is a smiley face.
