<H1>Animation of Wave Packet</H1>

This animation shows a traveling wave packet, representing the real part
of the wave function of a free particle.  The envelope of the wave
packet moves with the group velocity.  Individual waves within the
envelope move with the phase velocity.<P>

The program recognizes the following commands.  The command may be
executed by either clicking the button with the mouse (first column
below) or by pressing a key (second column below).
The mouse buttons may be removed from the screen by pressing the <b>M</b>
key.  Press <b>M</b> again to restore buttons.<p>
