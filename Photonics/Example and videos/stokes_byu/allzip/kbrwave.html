<H1>KBRWAVE</H1>
<H1>Lattice Waves in a Three-Dimensional KBr Crystal</H1>

This animation shows lattice waves in a three-dimensional crystal of KBr.<P>

The red
spheres are potassium ions (K+), and the yellow spheres are bromine ions
(Br-).
The animation starts with a longitudinal wave in the acoustic branch (LA)
with a wavelength equal to
the lattice  parameter <i>a</i>.
The wave is traveling in the +x direction, as indicated by the <i>k</i> 
vector.<p>

The program recognizes the following commands.  The command may be
executed by either clicking the button with the mouse (first column
below) or by pressing a key (second column below).
The mouse buttons may be removed from the screen by pressing the <b>M</b>
key.  Press <b>M</b> again to restore buttons.<p>

To change to waves in the optical branch, click on the "acoustic branch"
button (or press the "o" key).  The label on the button will change to
"optical branch."  To change waves back to the acoustic branch, click
on the button again (or press the "a" key).<p>

To change the wavelength, simply enter at the keyboard any positive
number (may include decimal point).  
Press the "enter" key at the end of the number.  This number
is the wavelength as a multiple number of lattice constants 
<i>a</i>.
