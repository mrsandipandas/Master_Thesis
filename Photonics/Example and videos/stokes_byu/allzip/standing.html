<H1>Animation of Standing Wave</H1>

This animation shows how a standing wave is produced from the
superposition of two waves.<P>

At the top of the screen, two traveling sine waves are shown.  They
have the same wavelength but are traveling in opposite directions.
At the bottom
of the screen, the superposition of the two waves is shown.
The result is a standing wave.
<P>

The program recognizes the following commands.  The command may be
executed by either clicking the button with the mouse (first column

The mouse buttons may be removed from the screen by pressing the <b>M</b>
