<H1>POLARIZE</H1>
<H1>Animation of Polarization of Light</H1>

This animation shows the polarization of light as it passes through various
optical elements: polarizer, quarter-wave plate, and half-wave plate. 
The vectors represent the electric field in an electromagnetic wave such as
light. <P>

The program recognizes the following commands:

<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>plate_1</B></TD><TD>
Select plate 1 so that the buttons along the bottom refer
plate 1.  The button turns red, indicating that plate 1 has been selected.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>plate_2</B></TD><TD>
Plate 2 appears on the screen and is selected 
so that the buttons along the bottom refer to 
plate 2.  The button turns red, indicating that plate 2 has been selected.
Clicking on <b>plate_2</b> again removes plate 2 from the screen.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>plate_3</B></TD><TD>
Plate 3 appears on the screen and is selected 
so that the buttons along the bottom refer to 
plate 3.  The button turns red, indicating that plate 3 has been selected.
Clicking on <b>plate_3</b> again removes plate 3 from the screen.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>rotate_+</B></TD><TD>
Rotates the selected plate by 5 degrees counterclockwise.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>rotate_-</B></TD><TD>
Rotates the selected plate by 5 degrees clockwise.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>polarizer</B></TD><TD>
Changes the selected plate to a polarizer.  The red line is the axis of
transmission.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>quarter</B></TD><TD>
Changes the selected plate to a quarter-wave plate.  The red line is the fast 
axis.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>half</B></TD><TD>
Changes the selected plate to a half-wave plate.  The red line is the fast 
axis.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>x,y</B></TD><TD>
Displays the x and y components of the electric field vectors.
Clicking on <b>x,y</b> again removes the components.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>highlight</B></TD><TD>
Highlights an electric field vector at a fixed location in the area
following the selected
plate.</TD>
