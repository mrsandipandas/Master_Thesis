<H1>Resolving Power of Hubble Space Telescope</H1>

The pictures described below show the core region of spiral galaxy M100,
the brightest galaxy in the Virgo cluster of galaxies, some tens of
millions of light-years from Earth.<p>

The file, <a href="ground.jpg">GROUND.JPG</a>, contains an image
made by a large ground-based telescope under the
best possible atmospheric conditions.<p>

The file, <a href="hubble.jpg">HUBBLE.JPG</a>, contains the same image made by
the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit around the earth above the
atmosphere.  This picture was taken December 31, 1993, shortly following
the December 1993 telescope-servicing space-shuttle mission where
corrective optics were installed to refocus light coming from the
telescope's flawed primary mirror and restored telescope performance to
the original specifications.
