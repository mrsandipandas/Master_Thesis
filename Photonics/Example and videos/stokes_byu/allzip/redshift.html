<H1>Red Shift of a Distant Super Cluster of Galaxies</H1>

BAS 11 is a super cluster of more than twenty dense galaxy clusters.
In all, it contains over 10,000 galaxies.  It is located just
below (to the south) the handle of the big dipper.  It is about
one billion light years away.<P>

The core of a star emits a continuous spectrum of light.  As this light
passes through the cooler outer atmosphere of the star, the atoms there
absorb some of it.  This light is absorbed by electrons which are
excited to higher energy levels in the atoms.  Since the energy levels
are quantized, only photons with the corresponding amount of energy will
be absorbed.  Thus, the light is absorbed only at certain wavelengths.
These appear as dark lines on top of a continuous spectrum of light
emitted by the star and is called the absorption spectrum.<P>

The image in the file, <a href="redshift.jpg">REDSHIFT.JPG</a>
shows a simulation of the absorption spectrum of the sun and
of BAS 11.  (Actual data is not taken with color photography.)
The dark lines in the red and in the blue is from absorption by hydrogen
atoms.  The dark line in the yellow is from sodium atoms.
The dark lines in the green are from magnesium and iron atoms.
The dark lines in the violet are from hydrogen, iron, calcium, and
potassium atoms.<P>

The shift in the spectrum of BAS 11 from the spectrum of the sun is
clearly seen.  The lines from BAS 11 are all shifted towards the red end
of the spectrum.  This shift (called the "red shift") is toward longer
wavelengths (smaller frequencies) and is caused by the Doppler effect.
The shift in frequency is about 7%.  This means that BAS 11 is traveling
away from us at about 7% of the speed of light.<P>
