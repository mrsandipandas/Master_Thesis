<H1>Animation of Traveling Sine Wave</H1>

This animation shows a traveling sine wave.<P>

The program recognizes the following commands.  The command may be
executed by either clicking the button with the mouse (first column
below) or by pressing a key (second column below).
The mouse buttons may be removed from the screen by pressing the <b>M</b>
key.  Press <b>M</b> again to restore buttons.<p>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>stop</B></TD><TD><B>s</B></TD><TD>
Stop animation.  Press <b>stop</b> again to resume animation.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>wavelength</B></TD><TD><B>w</B></TD><TD>
Lines appear one wavelength apart.  Press <b>wavelength</b> again to remove lines.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>period</B></TD><TD><B>p</B></TD><TD>
An audible click is heard each time one wavelength passes by.  
The time between the clicks
is the period of the wave.  The number of clicks per unit time is the frequency
of the wave. Press <b>period</b> again to stop the clicking.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>harmonic_motion</B></TD><TD><B>h</B></TD><TD>
A ball moves up and down with harmonic motion, following the point of the wave which intersects
the y axis.  This demonstrates that a point on the wave
undergoes simple harmonic motion in the vertical direction.
Press <B>harmonic_motion</B> again to remove the ball.</TD>
