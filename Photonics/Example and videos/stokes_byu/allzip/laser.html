<H1>LASER</H1>
<H1>Comparison of He-Ne Laser and City Lights</H1>

The file, <a href="laser.jpg">LASER.JPG</a>, contains
a photograph of an 8-mW He-Ne laser pointed at the camera.
The laser is in Provo, Utah, at night.  The camera is across Utah
Lake, several miles away.  The laser light is so intense, compared
to the city lights, that it caused blooming in the film.  This is
the diffuse red spot you can see in the photograph.<P>
