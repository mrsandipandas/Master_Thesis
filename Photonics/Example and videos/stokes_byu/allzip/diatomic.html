<H1>Animation of Lattice Waves in a
One-Dimensional Diatomic Crystal</H1>

This animation shows lattice waves in a one-dimensional diatomic
crystal.<P>

To change the wavelength, simply enter at the keyboard any positive
integer.  (Press the "enter" key at the end of the number.)  This number
is the wavelength as a multiple number of lattice constants 
<i>a</i>.<p>

For waves in the optical branch, press the <b>o</b> key.<p>

For waves in the acoustic branch, press the <b>a</b> key.
