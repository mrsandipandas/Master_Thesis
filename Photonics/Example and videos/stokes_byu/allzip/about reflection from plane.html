<H1>Reflection from plane</H1>

This animation shows the scattering of x rays from a plane of points.<P>

Dragging the mouse across the figure causes the angle of the scattered
x rays to change.  At about 30 degrees, the angle of scattered x rays
is equal to the angle of the incident x rays, and the scattered waves
are all in phase with each other.  This satisfies the law of
reflection.
