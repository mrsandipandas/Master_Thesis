<H1>Reflection from Crystal</H1>

This animation shows the scattering of x rays from a set of equivalent
points in a crystal.<P>

The angles of the incident and scattered x rays are constrained to be
always equal.  Dragging the mouse outside the crystal causes the angles
to change.  At about 37 degrees, the scattered waves are all in phase
with each other.  This angle satisfies Bragg's Law.<p>

The incident x ray scatters from a single point in each unit cell.
These points are all equivalent, and the scattering x rays will be
indentical.  Dragging the mouse around inside the crystal 
moves the points around inside the unit cells so that they are always
equivalent to each other.<p>

X rays are scattered by electrons, so the amplitude of the scattered
wave depends on the electron density at the points.  Electron density
is largest near the nucleus of an atom.  The atoms in the unit cells
are at (0,0,0) (the corners) and at (1/2,1/2,1/2) (the centers), so the
amplitude of the scattered wave is largest at those locations.  Note
that the amplitude of the wave scattered from (0,0,0) is larger than
the amplitude of the wave scattered from (1/2,1/2,1/2), indicating
that those are two different kinds of atoms.
