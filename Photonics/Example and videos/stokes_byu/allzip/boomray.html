<H1>Animation of a sonic boom (ray model)</H1>

This animation shows sound traveling from an airplane traveling across
the sky to a man standing on the ground.  The velocity
shown is with respect to the speed of sound.  The animation begins
with velocity=0.5 which means the aircraft is moving at half the speed
of sound.  As the airplane travels across the sky, the sound which the airplane
made at each previous position travels toward the man.
<P>

When the airplane is traveling slower than the speed of sound, the first
sound heard by the man came from the airplane when it was far away.  When
the airplane is traveling faster than the speed of sound, the first sound
heard by the man comes from the airplane when it was much closer.  For example,
when the airplane is traveling at twice the speed of sound, the first sound
heard by the man comes from the airplane when it was in the fourth position.
<p>

The velocity may be changed by typing in a number (including decimal points
if desired) at the keyboard, followed by pressing the <b>enter</b> key.
When the value is completely entered, the value shown on the screen will
change to the new value.<p>

The program recognizes the following commands.
