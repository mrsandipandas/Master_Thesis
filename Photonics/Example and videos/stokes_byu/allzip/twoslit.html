<H1>Double Slits and Particles</H1>

This animation shows what happens when particles are sent one at
a time through a double slit.  The particles can be either photons
or electrons.<P>

The program recognizes the following commands.  The command may be
executed by either clicking the button with the mouse (first column
below) or by pressing a key (second column below).
The mouse buttons may be removed from the screen by pressing the <b>M</b>
key.  Press <b>M</b> again to restore buttons.<p>

<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>beam</B></TD><TD><B>b</B></TD><TD>
The beam of particles does not pass through a double slit.
Each time you press <b>fire</b> (or the space bar), a particle is sent down the beam and
the position where it hits the screen is indicated by a white dot.
If you hold down the space bar, the particles will come more
frequently.
</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>double_slit</B></TD><TD><B>2</B></TD><TD>
The beam of particles passes through a pair of vertical
slits.  This causes the particles to be diffracted horizontally.
As in the beam mode, each time you press <b>fire</b> (or the space bar),
a particle is sent through the double slit and
the position where it hits the screen is indicated by a white dot.
If you hold down the space bar, the particles will come more
frequently.  As the position of many particles are accumulated on
the screen, a double-slit interference pattern becomes apparent.
