<H1>Reflection from Unit Cell</H1>

This animation shows the scattering of an x ray from points in a unit cell
in a crystal.<P>

The angle of the incident and scattered x rays is fixed.  Dragging the
mouse across the figure moves the point around inside the unit cell.
X rays are scattered by electrons, so the amplitude of the scattered
wave depends on the electron density at that point.  Electron density
is largest near the nucleus of an atom.  The atoms in this unit cell
are at (0,0,0) (the corners) and at (1/2,1/2,1/2) (the center), so the
amplitude of the scattered wave is largest at those locations.  Note
that the amplitude of the wave scattered from (0,0,0) is larger than
the amplitude of the wave scattered from (1/2,1/2,1/2), indicating
that those are two different kinds of atoms.
