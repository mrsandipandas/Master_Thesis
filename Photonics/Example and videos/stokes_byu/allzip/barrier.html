<H1>Animation of a wave packet tunneling through a barrier</H1>

This animation shows the probability density |psi|<sup>2</sup> of a 
wave packet as it tunnels through a barrier at x=0.  The width of the
barrier is very small on the scale shown.<p>

Note:<p> 

(1) Part of the
wave packet is transmitted through the barrier and part is reflected
from the barrier.<P>

(2) Oscillations in |psi|<sup>2</sup> are caused by interference between
the incident and reflected wave packets.<p>

(3) The wave packets become wider with time.  This is due to the uncertainty
in momentum which leads to increasingly uncertainty in position.
