<H1>Animation of adiabatic processes</H1>

This animation shows a gas inside a box.  The collisions are
elastic.  The gas can be adiabatically compressed or expanded by
slowly moving one of the walls of the box.  Free expansion can also be
observed by suddenly moving a wall.<P>

The total kinetic energy of the molecules is displayed at the top
of the screen.  When the gas is adiabatically compressed, the kinetic
energy increases.  When the gas is adiabatically expanded, the kinetic
energy decreases.  Under free expansion, the kinetic energy remains
constant.  The changes in kinetic energy are caused by collisions
with a moving wall.<P>

Note that when the gas is first compressed and then expanded, the
kinetic energy does not return to its original value.  This happens
because the speed of the wall's movement is a sizable fraction
of the average speed of the molecules, and the process is therefore
not "quasi-static".  If the speed of the wall were much smaller,
the kinetic energy would return to its original value, but then,
this animation would take much longer.<P>

<H1>OpenGL Version</H1>

The program recognizes the following commands.  The command may be
executed by either clicking the button with the mouse (first column
below) or by pressing a key (second column below).
The mouse buttons may be removed from the screen by pressing the <b>M</b>
key.  Press <b>M</b> again to restore buttons.<p>
The program recognizes the following commands:

<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>compress</B></TD><TD><B>C</B></TD><TD>
Compression.  The left wall moves to the right until you press
<B>S</B> or until the box has reached its minimum size.
</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>expand</B></TD><TD><B>E</B></TD><TD>
Expansion.  The left wall moves to the left until you press
<B>S</B> or until the box has reached its maximum size.
</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>free</B></TD><TD><B>F</B></TD><TD>
Free expansion.  The left wall suddenly moves to the left so that
the box has its maximum size.
</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>stop</B></TD><TD><B>S</B></TD><TD>
Stop compression or expansion.  Wall stops moving.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>quit</B></TD><TD><B>Q</B></TD><TD>
Quit program.</TD>
