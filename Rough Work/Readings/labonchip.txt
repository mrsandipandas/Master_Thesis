Impedence cytometry
Conventional DMF architecture - Droplets move by applying voltage between 2 electroes - droplets move based on angle change - Good mixing - fast kinetics - hundreds of trnasisitors can be used to do the same thing - individual transistor array - to move the droplets (same anaogy of mobile phone screens)
